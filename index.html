        <h1>About Me</h1>

        <h2>Who I am</h2>
        <p>
        My name is Taylor McFadden, and my life has been quite a roller coaster. I grew up as an only child and at around the age of 4 or 5, my parents 
        divorced and I moved from a few different houses until me and my mom solidified our living space in Liberty Center where we have lived for 9 years. I have 
        gone to 2 different preschools at Evergreen and Napoleon until I started kindergarden at Liberty Center Schools where I stayed until I went to Four County.

    <h2>My hobbies</h2>
        <p>
            I do a lot in my spare time, I love playing video games, listening to and making music, hanging out with friends, and driving. My favorite video 
        games include  titles such as Subnautica, Schedule 1, Call of Duty Ghosts and Advanced Warfare, and the Wolfenstein series just to name a few.
        My favorite games to play with my friends would include Phasmaphobia, Fortnite, and roblox. A few hobbies I have is making music
        which I have listed down below which I made in the trial version of FL Studio. Artists I listen to as inspiration for making music include Travis Scott,
        Playboi Carti, Don Toliver, Future, Etc. I consider myself to be an "audiophile", which basically means that I like to listen to high fidelity sounds
        and different kind of headphones. Me and my friends hung out this summer more then we  ever did, one of my friends has a lakehouse up near Mackinac 
        City Michigan and took me and 3 other people for 4 days, then I took 2 of my friends down to Gatlinberg Tennesee for a few days.

    <h2>My plan for life</h2>
        <p>
        My plan for after high school is to attend NorthWest State for a bachelor's degree in computer engineering. My plan for work is to either be an IT technician
        at a tech company, or be a game developer at a major game studio. Im not planning on having any kids so I would live by myself and enjoy life.
